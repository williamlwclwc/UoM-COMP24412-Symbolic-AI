1. What happens when ask for Chronosâ€™ cousins
The recurrsion of finding ancestor in cousin rule will not reach an end since chronos is the ancestor of himself(there is a cycle in the path).
2.(i)
There are 11 people in my_family.pl, the fact base is not complete enough, it can show who is my mother, 
but cannot show who is my mother's mother because I did not put that information in the fact base.
However, it can infer the relations(father, sibling, etc.) based on all facts we provided.
(ii) 
I think in the real world, there will be step father/mother, 
so it may be better just use arity 2 relation parent(X, Y) to present parent relation more precisely.
