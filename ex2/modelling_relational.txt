In sql, we often use "select" statement to query some data from tables according to some constraints.

If we assume tables to be facts, and constraints to be the rules we defined, and "select" procedure to be 
":-" implication, then the procedure in prolog will be similar to sql.

Sometimes we define our rules using other rules, this could be similar to sql query that using nesting 
"select" statements.
